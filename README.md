## Non-Technical Overview
Amazona is single-page Amazon clone app where users can view all orders and make a payment with Stripe.
#### Core Features: 
* Login, logout and create a new account. 
* Access to the list of products from Amazona.
* Buy items, make payment with Stripe and get track of the orders.
## Technical Overview

I focused on the following considerations: 
1. Design elegant UX without having a designer by leveraging open source UI libraries
2. Adhered to React and ES6 best practices to generate a true single page reactive web app experience.
3. Controlled access to paid content by syncing subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.
4. Applied Real Time Database allowing users to track the Orders History Page.
